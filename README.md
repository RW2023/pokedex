# PokiGame React App Repo

## The exercise: 

## Pokegame Component

Modify your component hierarchy so that App renders a component called Pokegame. Pokegame should take your list of 8 pokemon and randomly assign them into two hands of 4 cards each. It should then render two Pokedex components, one for each hand.

Once you’ve got this working, modify your Pokegame so that it also calculates the total experience for each hand of pokemon. It should pass this total to the Pokedex.

Next, have the Pokegame component determine which hand is the “winner,” where the winning hand is the one with the higher total experience. Then modify the Pokedex component one more time so that it accepts a prop of isWinner. If the Pokedex is the winning one, it should display the message “THIS HAND WINS!” at the bottom of the deck.

Now when you load the page, you should see two different hands with a randomly changing winner every time you refresh.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
